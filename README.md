# P7Server

###  Scala IDE for Graphics development based on Processing and Openframeworks ideas

## What am I looking at ?

P7 aims to be an alternative to Processing. Mixing the browser compatibility of Javascript and WebGL with the power of the Scala programming lenguaje.
You will be able to create awesome graphics, share them easly and program them with beautiful OOP + Functional code.

## Getting Started

On the libs folder it's necessary to download and uncompress [Thrust](https://github.com/breach/thrust/releases)
